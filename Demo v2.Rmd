#Summary

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Here I'm creating a summary for the data set `cars`
summary(cars)#summary() is a command in base R and the `cars` data set is also native to base R
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

summary(cars)#summary() is a command in base R and the `cars` data set is also native to base R
